Recipe.
In a mixing bowl, add milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking powder, and mix well.
Add ghee and mix it in using your fingers until it resembles bread crumbs.
Add milk, little by little, to the mixture and knead it into a smooth dough. Do not over-knead the dough.
Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 10-15 minutes.
In a saucepan, add sugar, water, cardamom pods, and saffron strands (if using) and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat and let it simmer until the sugar is completely dissolved.
Turn off the heat and keep the sugar syrup aside.
Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan on low heat.
While the oil is heating, make small balls out of the dough. The balls should be smooth and without any cracks.
Once the oil is hot, add the dough balls to the oil and fry them on low heat. Keep stirring occasionally until they turn golden brown in color.
Once they are cooked, take them out of the oil and place them on a paper towel to absorb any excess oil.
Add the fried it to the sugar syrup while it is still warm. Let them soak in the syrup for at least 2 hours before serving.
Serve warm or at room temperature.
